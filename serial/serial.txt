We have 2 devices under test and they are connecting to COM4 and COM5 serial ports on the PC.

Write a python script that will test the connection between device A and B, on both channels
(Chan 0 and Chan 1).

The test will try to send 100 packets on each channel from A to B and then B to A.

Catch the number of corrupted packets and number of packets lost.

Note: A receiving device may not know explicitly when a packet is lost.

Weâ€™d like to see you try to induce errors if you can.

Find the edge cases.

Document your coding, but also prepare a high level test plan for this and other tests
you can infer we might need.

Create a reporting/tracking structure for the execution and maintenance of these tests.

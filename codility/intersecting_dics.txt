Given an array A of non-negative integers, A[i] corresponds to the radius of a disc located at (0,i) on the Cartesian plane. Two discs are said to intersect iff they have at least one common point. Compute the total number of intersecting pairs of discs.

A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances from the point to two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length.

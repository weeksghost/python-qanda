For every prefix p we have to decide whether or not a number A[p] has appeared before. If
the number A[p] has appeared before then we can consider smaller indices. Otherwise, it is
not possible to obtain a smaller prefix than A[0..p].

Using the above reasoning we can iterate through array A using decreasing prefixes and
check whether the value A[p] has appeared before index p. Finally, we will find a prefix that
cannot be decreased, and that will be the result.
